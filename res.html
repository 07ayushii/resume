      <h2>AYUSHI BHATT</h2>
      <p>I am a passionate web developer with a keen interest in creating beautiful and functional websites.My name is AYUSHI BHATT and I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree. As a BCA student, I am deeply passionate about the world of technology and computing. From a young age, I've been fascinated by computers and their endless possibilities, which led me to choose this field of study.</p>
      My journey in the field of computer applications has been nothing short of exhilarating. I've delved into various subjects such as programming languages, database management, web development, and software engineering, gaining valuable insights and practical experience along the way.
      Throughout my academic career, I've actively participated in coding competitions, hackathons, and tech workshops, honing my skills and staying updated with the latest advancements in the industry. These experiences have not only enriched my knowledge but also fostered a strong sense of curiosity and innovation within me.
      As a BCA student, I understand the importance of continuous learning and adaptation in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. I am eager to explore new concepts, tackle complex problems, and contribute to innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology.
      Outside of academics, I enjoy exploring programming challenges, experimenting with new technologies, and collaborating with like-minded individuals to create impactful solutions. I believe in the power of teamwork and collective creativity to drive meaningful change.
